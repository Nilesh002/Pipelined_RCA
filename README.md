# Pipelined 4-Bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) in Verilog

## Overview

This project implements a pipelined 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) using Verilog. The design is optimized for Xilinx Vivado and enhances throughput by utilizing pipeline stages for parallel processing of addition operations.

## Features

- Pipelined architecture for improved throughput.
- 4-bit RCA implementation.
- Designed for Xilinx Vivado.
